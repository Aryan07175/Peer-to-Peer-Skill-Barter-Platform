Peer-to-Peer Skill Barter Platform

Problem: People want to learn skills but don’t always have money to pay.
Solution: Build a platform where users exchange skills — no money involved.

Frontend: Tinder-like swipe interface to match skill requests/offers.

Backend: Matching algorithm pairs people based on skills they can teach vs. want to learn.

Unique Twist: Time-based credit system (teach 1 hour = earn 1 hour credit).
